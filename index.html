        <p>California is the most populated state in the United States and has the largest economy of any state. It is a
            very diverse state, with many different kinds of people, cultures, and landscapes, including mountains,
            beaches, and deserts. The state is a major leader in agriculture, technology through Silicon Valley, and the
            entertainment industry in Hollywood. California officially joined the United States in 1850 after the
            Mexican-American War and the Gold Rush brought a large influx of settlers.</p>
